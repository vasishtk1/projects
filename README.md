# Projects
Below are descriptions and visuals for my computer science and engineering projects.

# Utilizing Computer Vision and Image Segmentation Techniques to Optimize Basketball Shot Trajectory
* Conducted research with Professor Ross Greer at UC Merced to utilize computer vision and image segmentation to optimize basketball shot trajectory. Created a hyper-personalized feedback mechanism for players on my varsity basketball team.

* **Published and presented paper at the 2024 IEEE MIT Undergraduate Research Technology Conference (Technology of Engineering).**
